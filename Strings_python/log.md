## Strings in Python
- sequence of characters enclosed with either a (') or a (").
- Strings in python are immutable, hence once created the cannot be changed, the operations that modify strings actually creates new strings
- In python you can access individual characters of string using indexing 
	### string[index]
- and extract potion of a string using
	### string[start:end]
- Strings can be concanated using the '+' operator or by using the 'join()' method.
### string methods
- split()
- join()
- upper()
- lower()
- strip()
- replace()
## 1. Upper() and Lower()
# upper()
- converts all characters in a string to uppercase
#lower()
- converts all characters in a string to lowercase.
## 2. Strip()
# strip()
- Removes leading and trailing whitespaces characters (spaces,tabs, newlines)
# istrip()
- Removes leading whitespace characters. That is at the beggining of statements
# rstrip()
Removes trailing whitespace characters. That is at the end of statements
## 3. split() and join()
# split()
- splits a string into a list of substrings based on a delimeter.
# join()
- join elements of an iterable into a single string using the specified delimeter e.g '-','+' etc
