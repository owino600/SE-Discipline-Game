### TREE DATA STRUCTURES
- you have 20 days to learn the theory around Binary Trees and grasp as much content and explanation for impementation in Day 21 onwards
## content
	# Binary Trees
	# Types of Binary Trees
	# Node structure of BT
- understand and write codes on the following:
- Level Order Traversal
